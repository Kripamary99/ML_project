# Traffic Congestion Prediction 

This project aims to predict traffic congestion at four junctions using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The workflow involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, time series transformation, and machine learning model implementation. Below are the key details:
